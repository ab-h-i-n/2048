        <p class="description"><b>2048 is a popular puzzle game that can be played on a computer or mobile device. Here are the basic steps to play the game</b></p>
        <br>
<ol class="custom-counter">
    <li> <label>Understand the objective:</label> The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, and combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.</li>
    <li> <label>Slide the tiles:</label> Use the arrow keys (or swipe in the direction you want to move the tiles) to slide the tiles on the grid. Every time you move the tiles, a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will appear on the grid.</li>
    <li> <label>Combine the tiles:</label> When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers. For example, if two tiles with the number 2 touch, they will merge to create a tile with the number 4.</li>
    <li> <label>Plan your moves:</label> The game can quickly become challenging, so plan your moves ahead of time to avoid getting stuck. Try to keep your highest valued tiles in one corner and work to combine lower valued tiles to free up space.</li>
    <li> <label>Keep playing:</label> The game continues until you either reach the 2048 tile or the grid fills up and there are no more moves left.</li>
    <li> <label>Try again:</label> If you don't reach the 2048 tile on your first try, don't worry. Keep practicing and try to improve your strategy each time you play.</li>
</ol>
